Neinspace
=========

# Intro
Neinspace is a vim plugin to clean your code in the following ways.
1. Show trailing spaces and tabs.
2. Remove trailing spaces and tabs.
3. Remove ^M at the end of the line, which is the carriage return in Windows.
4. Convert tab to spaces based on the 'tabstop' setting.

# Install
[Vundle] is the recommended plugin manager.
Add `Bundle 'initrc/neinspace'` to `.vimrc` and run `:BundleInstall`.

# Usage
Neinspace shows tab as `>-` and trailing space as `.`.

To remove trailing spaces, tabs, ^M and convert tab to spaces, add the following to `.vimrc`.

```
